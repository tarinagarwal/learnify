## 🚀 Getting Started

 ## AI Fallback System

 The project includes a robust AI fallback system to handle service disruptions and rate limiting, ensuring reliability for AI-powered features.

 ### Features
 - **Fallback AI Models**: Uses GROQ as the primary service and OpenAI as fallback for quiz generation, PDF chat, and language tutor features.
 - **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff for retries (configured via `VITE_AI_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`).
 - **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents repeated calls to failing services (`src/services/circuitBreaker.ts`).
 - **Graceful Degradation**: Provides dynamic mock responses (`src/services/mockAI.ts`) when both primary and fallback services fail.
 - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays AI service health (feature, provider, duration, status, error) on the admin dashboard (`/admin`) using Supabase Realtime (`src/components/MonitoringDashboard.tsx`).
 - **Access Control**: Restricts the admin dashboard to users with the `admin` role (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`).


### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)
- Docker Desktop (for local development)
- Supabase CLI (`npm install -g supabase`)
- Supabase account
- GROQ API key

### 🔐 OAuth Setup (Google & GitHub)

1. Create your own Supabase project.
2. Go to `Authentication → Providers` in Supabase dashboard.
3. Enable **Google** and **GitHub**, and provide Client ID/Secret.




### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learnify.git
cd learnify
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Start the local Supabase instance:

```bash
supabase start
```

5. Apply database migrations:

```bash
supabase db push
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

For detailed instructions on setting up and working with the database, please refer to our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#database-setup).

Key points:

- Local development uses Docker and Supabase CLI
- Migrations are stored in `/supabase/migrations`
- Follow migration guidelines when making database changes
- Test all changes locally before committing
